# tinyram #

This is an independent reimplementation of ideas from vnTinyRAM, as
described in the publications listed below.

Note that the processor architecture we implement is somewhat different
from what's described in the above architecture spec; we call this
architecture "Lajos" to avoid confusion with (vn)TinyRAM.

If you have pandoc, LaTeX, and some ancillary packages available on your
system, you can `make` in the doc directory for an overview of our
architecture and a guide for using the executables.

To actually run verified computations on this system, you will need
to check out the latest
[Pepper system](https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper).
(Note also: this git project is a submodule of Pepper.)
